Hi, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

This is an ever changing collection of thoughts and notes.

This method of note taking is shamelessly stolen from [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

These notes are built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and uses [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy/).
