The majority of my "reading" over the past few years has been done via audiobooks when I'm walking the dog.

Recently, I've switched to listening to fiction whilst walking and reading non-fiction on my Kindle so that I can make notes to refer back to. These notes are listed below.

You can find my entire reading list on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16009757.Michael_Heap)

## Recent Notes
