title: Leadership and Self Deception

A fable by the Arbinger Institute. [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180463.Leadership_and_Self_Deception)

# Self-betrayal and self-deception

- An act contrary to what I feel I should do for another is called an act of self-betrayal
- When I betray myself, I start to see the world in a way that justifies my self-betrayal
- When I see the world in a self-justifying way, my view of reality becomes distorted
- When I betray myself, I enter "the box"
- Over time, certain boxes become characteristic of me and I carry them with me
- By being "in the box" I provoke others to be "in the box". Once started this cycle is hard to break
- "In the box" we invite mutual mistreatment and give each other reasons to stay "in the box"

# Examples

## The baby is crying

You wake in the middle of the night because the baby is crying. Your first instinct is to get up and help the baby. If you do not act on this, you start to rationalise your decision not to.

You'll start coming up with excuses like "I always get up" and "I've got a busy morning". Self-justification leads to self-deception. You inflate your own needs and wishes above those of others, leading you to blame them. In this example, you'd start to feel angry at your spouse for not waking up to help the baby. You think of yourself as a victim and your spouse as lazy.

You do not develop negative emotions towards your spouse because of something they did. Instead, you develop them because _you_ did not do something, and now you have to justify that to yourself by telling yourself that they did something wrong.

Your normal view of your spouse as someone that needs your help becomes distorted due to your self-betrayal. You:

1. Inflate others faults
2. Inflate your own virtue
3. Inflate the value of things that justify this self-betrayal
4. Blame others

## Collusion

When two people are in the box towards each other, they both need the other person to provoke them to feel justified in their perception,

Imagine the following:

- A boss blames and micromanages a worker
- The worker thinks the boss is annoying and is hovering
- The worker does not complete a task correctly to spite the boss
- The boss sees a lazy, incompetent worker and blames them

Then the cycle continues

# Getting out of the box

Things that don't work:

1. Trying to change others
2. Doing my best to cope with others
3. Leaving
4. Communicating
5. Implementing new techniques
6. Changing my behaviour

The key to getting out of the box is to stop resisting others. Honour them as people, not as objects. They have needs, hopes and worries as legitimate as my own.

# Summary

- Self betrayal leads to self-deception and "the box"
- When you are in the box, you cannot focus on the results
- Your influence and success will depend on being out of the box
- You get out of the box as you cease resisting other people
- Don’t try to be perfect. Do try to be better
- Don’t use the vocabulary "the box" and so on – with people who don’t already know it. Do use the principles in your own life
- Don’t look for others' boxes. Do look for your own
- Don’t accuse others of being in the box. Do try to stay out of the box yourself
- Don’t give up on yourself when you discover you have been in the box. Do keep trying
- Don’t deny that you have been in the box when you have been. Do apologise, then just keep marching forward, trying to be more helpful in the future.
- Don’t focus on what others are doing wrong. Do focus on what you can do right to help
- Don’t worry whether others are helping you. Do worry whether you are helping others.
