# Quotes from the book

## Introduction: The first 90 days

> Falling prey to the “action imperative.” You feel as if you need to take action, and you try too hard, too early to put your own stamp on the organization. You are too busy to learn, and you make bad decisions and catalyze resistance to your initiatives.

This is one that I can see myself falling prey to. I like to make an impact wherever I am, and after many years at the same company it's easy to jump in to a new project having existing context for how the company behaves. In a new company you have to be thoughtful in adapting to your new environment. Don't arrive with "the" answer, take the time to observe and reflect before taking action.

---

> Attempting to do too much. You rush off in all directions, launching multiple initiatives in the hope that some will pay off. People become confused, and no critical mass of resources gets focused on key initiatives.

If you bias towards action you may be tempted to start lots of projects at once and see what sticks. Each project will have it's own success criteria and stakeholders and you want to show each of them that you're thinking of them. It's likely that they all fail and you look uncoordinated to your new peers.

## Chapter 1: Prepare Yourself

> You also need to learn to strike the right balance between keeping the wide view and drilling down into the details. This juggling act can be challenging, because what had been the fifty-thousand-foot view in your previous role may be equivalent to the world at five thousand feet, or even five hundred feet, in your new job.

This was eye opening for me. When your role increases in scope your 50,000 foot view becomes even wider. You can't compare your high level view across roles. The more senior you become, the higher your view gets.

---

> Decision making becomes more political - less about authority, and more about influence. That isn’t good or bad; it’s simply inevitable.

> the issues you’re dealing with become much more complex and ambiguous when you move up a level—and your ability to identify “right” answers based solely on data and analysis declines correspondingly. Decisions are shaped more by others’ expert judgments and who trusts whom, as well as by networks of mutual support.

Yes! In an ideal world all decisions are evaluated on merit, but the world just doesn't work that way. It's easy to base decisions on data when you're making widgets, but as you encounter problems that haven't yet been solved it comes down to experience and intuition.

---

> Second, at a higher level of the organization, the other players are more capable and have stronger egos. Remember, you were promoted because you are able and driven; the same is true for everyone around you.

We go through this in education. You can be the big fish in a little pond at primary school, then you gain new peers at secondary school, then college. Each time you progress your competition gets stronger.

It's important to remember that the same happens in business. The more senior you are, the more senior your peers are.

---

> Joining a new company is akin to an organ transplant—and you’re the new organ. If you’re not thoughtful in adapting to the new situation, you could end up being attacked by the organizational immune system and rejected.

This is a great analogy for a strong leader joining a new company. You can be life changing for the company, but only once you're accepted as a part of the organisation.

---

> Focus, too, on understanding the operating model, planning and performance evaluation systems, and talent management systems, because they often powerfully influence how you can most effectively have an impact.

You could have the best ideas in the world, but if they're not aligned with how the business incentivises people you're going to fail.

> Likewise, every organization typically has a shared language—a long list of acronyms, for instance, describing business units, products, processes, projects, and other elements of the company. So it’s essential that you invest early on in learning to speak like the locals.

A non-trivial amount of my time in previous roles has been explaining acronyms and how business units fit together to my teams + new hires across the business. Don't underestimate how valuable this is

---

> A good example is the general beliefs people in the company have about the right way to distribute power based on position. Are executives in particular roles given lots of decision-making power from Day 1, or is the degree of authority a function of seniority?

If you get this wrong it's likely to backfire on you. In some orgs your title gives you the ability to make decisions, in others it doesn't. Make sure you know which type of org you're in before trying to push an agenda

---

How to evaluate a new organisation:

> **Influence**. How do people get support for critical initiatives? Is it more important to have the support of a patron within the senior team, or affirmation from your peers and direct reports that your idea is a good one?

> **Meetings**. Are meetings filled with dialogue on hard issues, or are they simply forums for publicly ratifying agreements that have been reached in private?

> **Execution**. When it comes time to get things done, which matters more—a deep understanding of processes or knowing the right people?

---

## Chapter 2: Accelerate your learning

> A baseline question you always should ask is, “How did we get to this point?” Otherwise, you risk tearing down existing structures or processes without knowing why they were put there in the first place.

Without understanding the org's history you don't know if things need to change. There might be a good reason that things are the way they are, or it may give you confidence that things need to change

Ask the following questions to gain an understanding of how the business operates + quantifies success:

> ### Questions About the Past
>
> **Performance**
>
> - How has this organization performed in the past? How do people in the organization think it has performed?
> - How were goals set? Were they insufficiently or overly ambitious?
> - Were internal or external benchmarks used?
> - What measures were employed? What behaviors did they encourage and discourage?
> - What happened if goals were not met?
>
> **Root Causes**
>
> - If performance has been good, why has that been the case?
> - What have been the relative contributions of strategy, structure, systems, talent bases, culture, and politics?
> - If performance has been poor, why has that been the case? Do the primary issues reside in the organization’s strategy? Its structure? Its technical capabilities? Its culture? Its politics?
>
> **History of Change **
>
> - What efforts have been made to change the organization? What happened?
> - Who has been instrumental in shaping this organization?
>
> ### Questions About the Present
>
> **Vision and Strategy **
>
> - What is the stated vision and strategy?
> - Is the organization really pursuing that strategy? If not, why not? If so, will the strategy take the organization where it needs to go?
>
> **People**
>
> - Who is capable, and who is not?
> - Who is trustworthy, and who is not?
> - Who has influence, and why?
>
> **Processes**
>
> - What are the key processes?
> - Are they performing acceptably in quality, reliability, and timeliness? If not, why not?
>
> **Land Mines **
>
> - What lurking surprises could detonate and push you offtrack?
> - What potentially damaging cultural or political missteps must you avoid?
>
> **Early Wins **
>
> - In what areas (people, relationships, processes, or products) can you achieve some early wins?
>
> ### Questions About the Future
>
> **Challenges and Opportunities **
>
> - In what areas is the organization most likely to face stiff challenges in the coming year? What can be done now to prepare for them?
> - What are the most promising unexploited opportunities? What would need to happen to realize their potential?
>
> **Barriers and Resources **
>
> - What are the most formidable barriers to making needed changes?Are they technical? Cultural? Political?
> - Are there islands of excellence or other high-quality resources that you can leverage?
> - What new capabilities need to be developed or acquired?
>
> **Culture**
>
> - Which elements of the culture should be preserved?
> - Which elements need to change?

---

> Natural historians. Keep an eye out for “old-timers” or natural historians—people who have been with the organization for a long time and who naturally absorb its history

Search out the "old-timers" who have been with the org for a long time. You can learn all about how the org came to be the way it is, the trials it's been through and the roots of its current culture and politics.

---

Interview your peers, reports + reporting chain when you join the company to help plan your roadmap. Ask them essentially the same five questions:

> 1. What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face in the near future)?
> 2. Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges?
> 3. What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?
> 4. What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities?
> 5. If you were me, what would you focus attention on?

---

> How people answer can also tell you a lot about your new team and its politics. Who answers directly, and who is evasive or prone to tangents? Who takes responsibility, and who points fingers? Who has a broad view of the business, and who seems stuck in a silo?

In a lot of cases, _how_ people say things (or don't say things) is a lot more informative than what they're actually saying.

---

> Assess how things are going at key interfaces. You will hear how salespeople, purchasing agents, customer service representatives, and others perceive your organization’s dealings with external constituencies. You will also learn about problems they see that others do not.

Your product and engineering teams may think they know what customers want, but make sure to spend time with the support and sales teams. They're talking to customers day in, day out and can provide a lot of context

---

## Chapter 4: Negotiate Success

> If there are parts of the organization—products, facilities, people—about which your new boss is proprietary, it is essential to identify them as soon as possible. You don’t want to find out that you’re pressing to shut down the product line your boss started up or to replace someone who has been his loyal ally. So try to deduce what your boss is sensitive about. You can do this by understanding your boss’s personal history, by talking to others, and by paying close attention to facial expression, tone, and body language. If you’re uncertain, float an idea gently as a trial balloon, and then watch his reactions closely.

This is known as "Identify the untouchables". Even if things don't make sense to you, what will you burn your goodwill on if you try to change it?

---

> You may find it helpful to talk to others who have worked with your boss in the past. Naturally, you must do this judiciously. Be careful not to be perceived as eliciting criticism of how the boss leads. Stick to less fraught issues, such as how the boss prefers to communicate. Listen to others’ perspectives, but base your evolving strategy chiefly on your own experience.

By asking your peers how your boss works best, you can tailor your communication styles and proposed roadmap to meet their expectations, setting yourself up for success.

---

## Chapter 6: Achieve Alignment

> Reporting relationships lead to compartmentalization or diffusion of accountability. Reporting relationships help you observe and control the workings of your group, clarify responsibility, and encourage accountability. Hierarchical reporting relationships make these tasks easier but can lead to compartmentalization and poor information sharing. Complex reporting arrangements, such as matrix structures, broaden information sharing and reduce compartmentalization but can diffuse accountability.

tl;dr: Choose what you're optimising for. Having worked on a team that did matrix reporting but lacked in accountability, I bias towards heirarchical reporting lines and being intentional when it comes to information sharing.

## Chapter 8: Create alliances

> Alliance building entails figuring out whose support you need, mapping the patterns of influence, and identifying potential support and opposition. Success in these actions helps you identify pivotal people, understand their motivations, situational pressures, and perceptions of the alternatives, and craft the right strategies to build your winning alliances.

To be successful in your role you need the support of others. To do that, you need to understand what drivers and pressures they have and ensure that your plan is beneficial to them too.

Here's a process to help you evaluate which alliances to build:

> 1. What are the critical alliances you need to build—both within your organization and externally—to advance your agenda?
> 2. What agendas are other key players pursuing? Where might they align with yours, and where might they come into conflict?
> 3. Are there opportunities to build long-term, broad-based alliances with others? Where might you be able to leverage shorter-term agreements to pursue specific objectives?
> 4. How does influence work in the organization? Who defers to whom on key issues of concern?
> 5. Who is likely to support your agenda? Who is likely to oppose you? Who is persuadable?
> 6. What are the motivations of pivotal people, the situational pressures acting on them, and their perceptions of their choices?
> 7. What are the elements of an effective influence strategy? How should you frame your arguments? Might influence tools such as incrementalism, sequencing, and action-forcing events help?
